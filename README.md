# Final_Project_ML_Model-building
Overview This project endeavors to develop an application incorporating three machine learning models: Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and KNN Classifier. Additionally, it places special emphasis on prediction utilizing the Random Forest model, encompassing significant image classification procedures, in-depth Natural Language Processing (NLP) operations, and a customer recommendation system. The objective is to integrate these diverse machine learning processes into a unified User interface application.
